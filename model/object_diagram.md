(remove: provide a description of the current model you describe below)

(remove: use images!!!)
(remove: I added an example image to illustrate [**how to use Markdown**](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), maybe consider a tool like [**Haroodpad**](http://pad.haroopress.com/user.html) )

(remove: More decription)
(remove: Maybe a second or third diagram to highlight a point or aspect)

(remove: each diagram markdown file should roughly follow this template)
